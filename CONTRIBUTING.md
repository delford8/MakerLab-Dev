## Contributions ##
Contributions are welcome if they meet the following criteria:

* Language is english (also spanish is allowed).
* Coding style (naming, etc.) and quality should fit to the current state.

If you want to contribute, please create a new issue for the feature or bug (if the issue doesn't exist yet) so we
can see who is working on something and can discuss possible solutions.

Apart of that, contributions from non-developers are welcome as well. You can test the app, submit issues or
suggestions, packet descriptions or documentations about the concepts of the app itself. Please use markdown files/syntax for this purpose.

If you have questions about that, don't hesitate to ask by submitting an issue.
